Building a People Identification and Gender Classification

This documentation outlines the process for developing a People Identification and Gender Classification system using a custom dataset. The system will identify the number of individuals in an image and classify their gender.
1. Technologies Needed
Programming Languages

    Python: Primary language for machine learning and computer vision tasks.

Libraries and Frameworks

    OpenCV: Image processing.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch: Neural network development.
    scikit-learn: Additional machine learning tools.
    NumPy and Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Matplotlib or Seaborn: Visualization of results.

Dataset Creation Tools

    Labeling Tools: LabelImg, VGG Image Annotator (VIA) for annotating images.

Hardware

    GPU: For accelerated training and inference of deep learning models.

Development Environment

    Google Colab: Interactive development platform.
    IDE: Google Colab or VSCode for coding.

2. Creating Your Own Dataset
Step 1: Data Collection

    Image Sources:
        Public domain datasets (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels).
        Web scraping (ensure copyright compliance).
        Capturing custom images.

Step 2: Data Annotation

    Labeling: Use tools like LabelImg or VIA.
    Bounding Boxes: Annotate each person in the image.
    Gender Labeling: Assign labels (e.g., Male, Female, Other) to each bounding box.

Step 3: Data Format

    Save annotated data in a compatible format (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC).

3. Model Development
Step 1: Preprocessing

    Image Resizing: Standardize dimensions.
    Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
    Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping.

Step 2: Model Selection

    Choose an architecture for object detection and gender classification:
        YOLO (You Only Look Once): For real-time detection.
        Faster R-CNN: For higher accuracy.

Step 3: Model Training

    Data Splitting: Divide dataset into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.
    Train the model with the training set and validate using the validation set.
    Monitor loss and accuracy metrics throughout training.

4. Evaluation and Testing

    Evaluate performance on the test set.
    Use metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection and classification accuracy for gender detection.

5. Deployment

    Deploy the trained model in an application:
        Web Application: Utilize Flask or Django for an image upload interface.
        Mobile Application: Use TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile for mobile deployment.

6. User Interface

    Develop an interface for users to upload images, displaying:
        Total count of individuals.
        Count of each gender.
        Visual bounding boxes with labels around detected individuals.

7. Iterate and Improve

    Collect user feedback for ongoing improvements.
    Enhance dataset diversity to boost model accuracy.

Conclusion

Following these steps and utilizing the specified technologies will enable the creation of an effective system for counting individuals in images and identifying their gender.
