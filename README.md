Building a People Identification and Gender Classification

System Using Custom Datasets

To develop a project that identifies the number of people in a picture and counts each gender using a
custom dataset, you'll need to use several technologies and follow a structured approach. Here’s a
detailed plan:
1. Technologies Needed
• Programming Languages:
• Python: Commonly used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
• Libraries and Frameworks:
• OpenCV: For image processing.
• TensorFlow or PyTorch: For building and training neural networks.
• scikit-learn: For additional machine learning tools.
• NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• Matplotlib or Seaborn: For visualization of results.
• Dataset Creation Tools:
• Labeling Tools: Tools like LabelImg or VGG Image Annotator (VIA) for annotating
images.
• Hardware:
• GPU: A powerful GPU will accelerate training and inference for deep learning
models.
• Development Environment:
• GoogleCollab Notebook: For interactive development.
• IDE: Such as GoogleCollab or VSCode for coding.

2. Creating Your Own Dataset
Step 1: Data Collection
• Images: Gather images that contain a variety of people in different settings (e.g., public
spaces, events, etc.).
• Sources can include:
• Public domain image datasets (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels).
• Web scraping (ensure compliance with copyright).
• Capturing your own images.

Step 2: Data Annotation
• Labeling: Use tools like Labelling or VIA to annotate each image.
• Bounding Boxes: Draw bounding boxes around each person in the image.
• Gender Labeling: Assign a gender label (e.g., Male, Female, Other) to each
bounding box.

Step 3: Data Format
• Save the annotated data in a format compatible with your chosen libraries (e.g., COCO
format, Pascal VOC).
3. Model Development
Step 1: Preprocessing
• Image Resizing: Resize images to a uniform dimension.
• Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
• Data Augmentation: Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping to enhance the
dataset.
Step 2: Model Selection
• Choose a model architecture suitable for object detection and gender classification, such as:
• YOLO (You Only Look Once): For real-time object detection.
• Faster R-CNN: For high accuracy in object detection tasks.

Step 3: Model Training
• Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 20% validation,
10% testing).
• Train your model using your training dataset, validating it with the validation set.
• Monitor loss and accuracy metrics.
4. Evaluation and Testing
• Evaluate your model’s performance on the test set.
• Use metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection and classification
accuracy for gender detection.
5. Deployment
• Once your model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in an application:
• Web Application: Use Flask or Django to create a web interface for uploading
images.
• Mobile Application: Use TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile for deploying the
model on mobile devices.

6. User Interface
• Create an interface that allows users to upload an image and displays:
• The total count of people.
• Count of each gender.
• Visual bounding boxes around detected people with labels.

7. Iterate and Improve
• Gather user feedback and continue to improve the dataset and model.
• Consider collecting more diverse data to enhance model accuracy.

Conclusion
By following these steps and utilizing the mentioned technologies, you can create a system that
effectively counts people in images and identifies their gender.
